    <h2>Bulldogs final SOCON Game Of The Year</h2>
    <p>The bulldogs battled against Furman in their final SOCON game of the football
      season. They were coming off of a loss against Western Carolina. In the first half of the battle at Furman, the bulldogs went scoreless. In the second half however, they scored 14 in the third quater and 6 in the fourth. They lost that game 56-20 against the palladains.</p>

    <h2>Bulldogs In The NFL</h2>
    <p>Due to graduate on May 6, Citadel All-American Tyler Renew already has a job interview lined up.With the Atlanta Falcons. Minutes after the NFL Draft ended on Saturday, Renew signed as a free agent with the Falcons. The fullback will report to the Falcons' rookie camp on May 12.A bit later, Citadel linebacker Tevin Floyd announced on Twitter that he has signed with the Arizona Cardinals."It's kind of surreal," said Renew, who spent the last three days studying for and taking his final exams at The Citadel while also keeping an eye on the draft. "You think about playing on the big stage on Sunday nights, practicing with all those big-name guys."Coming from a small high school and a small school like The Citadel and getting the opportunity to make it to the highest level of football, it's humbling. I couldn't be more grateful for the support of my family and friends throughout this whole process."</p>

      <p>Renew rushed for 1,096 yards and four touchdowns last season as the Bulldogs won a second straight Southern Conference title and led the nation in rushing. He is No. 5 on The Citadel's career rushing chart with 2,828 yards.Renew impressed scouts at South Carolina's pro day in March, putting on about 14 pounds to measure in at 5-11 1/2 and 231 pounds while running the 40-yard dash in 4.57 to 4.64 seconds.</p>

      <p>The Falcons, who lost to New England in the Super Bowl, drafted one running back, taking Brian Hill (6-1, 219) of Wyoming in the fifth round. Former Falcons fullback Patrick DiMarco, from South Carolina, signed with Buffalo in March."The Falcons expressed to me how much they use the fullback, the formations they like to run," Renew said. "They said the fullback is vital to their offense, and they want me to come in and show the grit and toughness I showed at The Citadel and prove my worth at that level."Floyd, an all-SoCon linebacker at 6-1 and 238 pounds, was second on the Bulldogs with 86 tackles, including two sacks and 8.5 tackles for loss. He's third at The Citadel in career tackles since 2000 with 295 and ended his career with 38 straight starts.</p>

     <h2>Bulldogs Head Coach</h2>
     <p>Brent Thompson was named The Citadel's 25th head football coach on January 19, 2016, and in his first year led the Bulldogs to unprecedented heights while authoring one of the best seasons in Southern Conference history.Thompson’s first season in charge featured a program-record 10-game winning streak, a single-season school-record six road victories, only the seventh 8-0 conference record in 84 years of SoCon football, a second consecutive conference championship, a No. 6 national seed in the FCS Playoffs and the first home playoff game in 24 years.</p>
     <p>He was named Southern Conference Coach of the Year for the 10-2 campaign that resulted in the first time in program history with back-to-back playoff appearances. Thompson shattered The Citadel’s record for wins by a first-year head coach of six that had stood for 100 years and was the second coach in conference history to win eight SoCon games in his first season while becoming the only first-year head coach to lead the Bulldogs to the FCS Playoffs.</p>
     <p>Thompson produced three All-Americans, two Academic All-Americans, the Southern Conference Defensive Player of the Year, the Southern Conference Jacobs Blocking Award winner and 11 All-Southern Conference Performers in 2016. In addition, The Citadel claimed eight SoCon player of the week accolades, one SoCon Student-Athlete of the Week and one conference player of the month.</p>
